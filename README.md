## Idea Description
A web application that allows users to log their daily activities, providing a platform to track time spent on various tasks and reflect on productivity. Users can analyze their time usage to identify patterns, set personal improvement goals, and visualize trends over time. By offering insights into daily time allocation, this self-reflective tool can enhance personal productivity and help users prioritize tasks effectively.

## Pseudo Code
// User Registration
function registerUser(name, email, password):
    hashedPassword = hash(password)  // Secure password storage
    userId = saveToDatabase(User, {name, email, hashedPassword})
    return userId

// User Login
function loginUser(email, password):
    user = findUserByEmail(email)
    if user and verifyHash(password, user.password):
        return user.id  // Successful login
    else:
        return "Invalid credentials"

// Log Activity
function logActivity(userId, activityName, duration, date):
    activityId = saveToDatabase(Activity, {name: activityName, duration, date, userId})
    return activityId

// View Activities
function getUserActivities(userId):
    return fetchFromDatabase(Activity where userId = userId)

// Edit Activity
function editActivity(activityId, newName, newDuration, newDate):
    updateDatabase(Activity, activityId, {name: newName, duration: newDuration, date: newDate})

// Delete Activity
function deleteActivity(activityId):
    removeFromDatabase(Activity, activityId)

// Set Goals
function setGoal(userId, goal):
    saveToDatabase(Goal, {userId, goal})

// Visualize Trends
function visualizeTimeUsage(userId):
    activities = getUserActivities(userId)
    generateCharts(activities)  // Create charts based on activity data
